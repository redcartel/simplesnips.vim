simplesnips     [simplesnips]

by Carter Adams (redcartel)

usage:

:Sn snippit-name

Inserts the contents of the file snippit-name below the current cursor, if
executed on a blank line, the blank line is removed

config:

In your config file:


    let g:simplesnipsDir= $HOME . "/path/to/your/snips/dir/"


You _must_ include the trailing "/"

Snippits are plain text file. The only transformation that occurs is that the
pattern <<FileSlug>> is replaced by the filename of the current file without
its extension. <<FileSlugLower>> is the same but lowercase.

Look at the following snippit:


// lowercase slug: <<FileSlugLower>>

export default class <<FileSlug>> {
}


If inserted in a file called MyClass.js, the inserted text would be


// lowercase slug: myclass

export default class MyClass {
}
