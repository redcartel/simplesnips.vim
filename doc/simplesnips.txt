Simple Snips                    *simplesnips*

by Carter Adams (https://github.com/redcartel/simplesnips.vim)

Simple snippits. Add the following line to your config file:

    `g:simplesnipsDir = $HOME . "/path/to/your/snips/folder/"`

Then the command:

    `:Sn snippitname`

Will insert the text of the file `/path/to/your/snips/folder/snippitname` 
into your code at the current location, or below your current line if the
current line is not blank.

Autocompletion of snippit names should be enabled.

The only processing of snippit text is that the pattern `<<FileSlug>>` is
replaced by the current file's filename without the extension. So for instance
`class <<FileSlug>>` would become `class MyClass` when inserted into a file 
called `MyClass.js`

Similarly `<<FileSlugLower>>` is replaced by the name of the file in lowercase,
minus the extension. So `myclass` in the above example.

TODO: Insert at current indentation level

TODO: Allow snippits organized in sub-folders

TODO: Get it working on Windows (autocompletion function uses `system('ls')`)

TODO: Other improvements? I don't want anything complicated like supporting
the formats of other snippits plugins. This is for people who want to write
a personal collection of templates.
